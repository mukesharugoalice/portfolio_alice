    entrepreneurship support, and mental health services. This project, Mindlift, directly tackles
    the root causes of unemployment by:

    âœ“ Skills Gap: Vocational/digital training for market-ready skills  
    âœ“ Mental Health: Counseling and resilience building  
    âœ“ Opportunity Creation: Entrepreneurship support  

    Why We Must Act Now:  
    Without intervention, this will:  
    â€¢ Push more youth into extreme poverty  
    â€¢ Widen gender inequalities (women face double discrimination)  
    â€¢ Create long-term societal burdens from untreated mental health issues  

    Mindlift's Transformational Impact:  
    By solving this problem, Mindlift will:  
    âœ” Break the unemployment-mental health cycle by equipping youth with both skills and
    emotional resilience.  
    âœ” Increase job placements and business startups, directly reducing unemployment rates.  
    âœ” Create a healthier, more stable community where young people can thrive economically
    and emotionally.

    st.header("Problem Statement")
    st.markdown(""" In Rwanda, 21.5% of youth (16-30 years old) are unemployed, primarily due to a mismatch
    between their skills and labor market demands, as well as fierce competition for limited jobs.
    At the same time, 27.4% of youth (14-25 years old) suffer from psychological disorders
    such as anxiety and depression, often worsened by the stress of unemployment. These two
    issues feed into each otherâ€”unemployment leads to poor mental health, and poor mental
    health makes it harder to find and keep a job. Without addressing both problems together,
    efforts to reduce youth unemployment will remain incomplete, trapping young people in
    cycles of poverty and instability.

The **Mindlift Coordination Plan** outlines a structured approach to team engagement, participant involvement, and stakeholder management to support youth development. Key strategies include **weekly team check-ins**, collaborative planning, and peer mentorship to ensure progress. Participants provide feedback through forums and anonymous channels, while stakeholders like employers and donors receive tailored updates via reports, infographics, and meetings. The plan emphasizes **inclusive decision-making**, conflict resolution, and transparency. Additionally, it addresses challenges such as **skills mismatch, mental health stigma, and job access** through employer partnerships, counseling rebranding, and internship guarantees. Solutions like startup grants, caregiver stipends, and bias-reduction initiatives further enhance program sustainability.

Progress is tracked daily via attendance sheets and WhatsApp, weekly through mental health check-ins and employer SMS surveys, and monthly via visual dashboards. Success is measured by quantitative metrics (e.g., 60% job placement rate, 50% symptom reduction) and qualitative indicators (participant testimonials, employer feedback). Tools like Google Sheets and SMS ensure real-time monitoring, while contingencies like rural outreach and trial placements address challenges. The plan emphasizes community ownership, parallel skill/mental health support, and adaptive strategies to ensure sustainable outcomes.

    #### **1. Possible Trade-offs in the Project**  
    In implementing Mindlift, several trade-offs must be considered due to resource constraints, time limitations, and competing priorities:  

    - **Quality vs. Scale**  
        - *Option A:* High-quality, intensive training for a smaller group (e.g., 100 participants with deep mentorship).  
        - *Option B:* Broader reach with lighter touch (e.g., 300 participants with basic training but less individual support).  

    - **Short-term Employment vs. Long-term Entrepreneurship**  
        - *Option A:* Focus on immediate job placements (vocational training for existing jobs).  
        - *Option B:* Prioritize entrepreneurship (business training, seed grants, but fewer quick job placements).  

    - **Mental Health Support vs. Skills Training Intensity**  
        - *Option A:* More counseling sessions (stronger mental health impact but fewer training hours).  
        - *Option B:* More skills training (better employability but potentially weaker mental health progress).  

    - **Cost Efficiency vs. Participant Accessibility**  
        - *Option A:* Centralized training (lower costs but excludes rural youth with transportation challenges).  
        - *Option B:* Decentralized training (higher reach but more expensive due to multiple venues).

    |------------------------------|---------------------|----------|
    | **Quality over Scale**        | Smaller cohorts (100) with deep support | Ensures higher success rates (certifications, job placements) and stronger mental health impact. |
    | **Balanced Employment & Entrepreneurship** | 60% job-focused, 40% entrepreneurship | Immediate income (jobs) stabilizes participants, while entrepreneurship creates long-term opportunities. |
    | **Moderate Mental Health Integration** | Weekly (not daily) counseling + resilience training | Ensures mental health is addressed without sacrificing critical skills training time. |
    | **Semi-Decentralized Model** | Main urban hub + select rural outreach | Balances cost and accessibility; urban focus first (higher employer connections), then expands. |
    """)

    st.markdown("""
    #### **3. Deep Analysis of How Trade-offs Support Success**  

    - **Quality over Scale** â†’ Ensures measurable impact (75% certification rate, 60% employment) rather than superficial reach. High completion rates attract more partners/funders.  
    - **Balanced Job-Entrepreneurship Focus** â†’ Mitigates risk: if job market weakens, entrepreneurship provides alternatives. Also aligns with Rwandaâ€™s push for SME growth.  
    - **Moderate Mental Health Integration** â†’ Avoids overwhelming participants with therapy at the cost of skills, but still achieves the **50% anxiety/depression reduction** target.  
    - **Semi-Decentralized Model** â†’ Urban focus maximizes employer partnerships early (critical for job placements), while rural pilots test scalability for Phase 2.
